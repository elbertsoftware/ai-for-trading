    "Let's suppose we wanted to find all the tags that had the attribute `class=\"h2style\"`. Unfortunately, in this case, we can't simply pass this attribute to the `.find_all()` method. The reason is that the **CSS** attribute, `class`, is a reserved word in Python. Therefore, using `class` as a keyword argument in the `.find_all()` method, will give you a syntax error. To get around this problem, BeautifulSoup has implemented the keyword `class_` (notice the underscore at the end) that can be used to search for the `class` attribute. Let's see how this works.\n",
