Then, write a loop that uses the span information from each `match` to only print the numbers found in the original multi-line string. Your code should work in the general case where the numbers can have any number of digits. For example, if the numbers in the string were to change your code should still be able to find them and print them. Finally, in this exercise you cannot use `\\d` in your regular expression. \n",

Then notice that you can use the span's `end` and `start` index from consecutive matches to figure out the number of digits of each number. Use these indices to print the numbers found in the original multi-line string. You can use the `match.span()` method we saw before to find the `start` and `end` indices of each `match`. Alternatively, you can also use the `.start()` and `.end()` methods to extract the `start` and `end` indices of each match. The `match.start()` is equivalent to `match.span()[0]` and `match.end()` is equivalent to `match.span()[1]`."
