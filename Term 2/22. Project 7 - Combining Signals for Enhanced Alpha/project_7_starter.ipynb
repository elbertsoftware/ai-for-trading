    "## Instructions\n",
    "Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other packages that we're importing are `project_helper` and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.\n",

    "Recall from the lesson, that we’ll choose a min_samples_leaf parameter to be small enough to allow the tree to fit the data with as much detail as possible, but not so much that it overfits.  We can first propose 500, which is the number of assets in the estimation universe. Since we have about 500 stocks in the stock universe, we’ll want at least 500 stocks in a leaf for the leaf to make a prediction that is representative.  It’s common to multiply this by 2,3,5 or 10, so we’d have min samples leaf of 500, 1000, 1500, 2500, and 5000. If we were to try these values, we’d notice that the model is “too good to be true” on the training data.  A good rule of thumb for what is considered “too good to be true”, and therefore a sign of overfitting, is if the sharpe ratio is greater than 4.  Based on this, we recommend using min_sampes_leaf of 10 * 500, or 5,000.\n",
