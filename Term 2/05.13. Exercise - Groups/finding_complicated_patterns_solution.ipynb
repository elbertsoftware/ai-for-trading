    "# TODO: Finding email Addresses Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, our `sample_text` consists of a multi-line string with four different email addresses. Write a regular expression that is able to find all these email addresses. As usual, save the regular expression object in a variable called `regex`. Then use the `.finditer()` method to search the `sample_text` string for the given regular expression. Finally, write a loop to print all the `matches` found by the `.finditer()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINTS:** Notice that all the characters before the `@` symbol only contain lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers. To match this part of the email address we can use the character set `[a-z_0-9]` followed by the `+` metacharacter, to account for the fact that all email addresses must have at least one character or more before the `@` symbol. The `+` metacharacter matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For example, `ab+` will match `a` followed by any non-zero number of `b`â€™s, such as `ab` or `abb`, etc.., but it will not match just `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@` symbol is not a metacharacter so we can match it directly without the need of escaping it. Also, notice that the domain names contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, underscores, and dashes. Again we can use the characters set `[a-zA-Z_-]` followed by the `+` metacharacter, to account for the fact that all domains must have at least one character or more after the `@` symbol. To match any dot (`.`), we need to use the backslash (`\\.`) because the dot is a metacharacter. You can use the character set `[a-z]+` to match either `com`, `edu`, or `gov`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match the last email address you need to add an optional dot followed by another character set of only lowercase letters."
