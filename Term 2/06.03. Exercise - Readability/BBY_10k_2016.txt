Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.  We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers, who offer their products and services directly to customers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. The retail business is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers who offer products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. The retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins. Table of Contents Table of Contents As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. Consumer electronics products are highly susceptible to technological advancement and changes in consumer preferences. In general, consumer electronics product life cycles (which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence) have become shorter and less predictable. This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers. Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business. These factors affect us in a number of ways, for example: •the emergence of new products and categories (for example, wearable devices); the emergence of new products and categories (for example, wearable devices); •the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets); the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets); •cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smart phones on demand for GPS, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.); cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smart phones on demand for GPS, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.); •intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates) which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates; intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates) which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates; •unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3D and Ultra-HD televisions); unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3D and Ultra-HD televisions); •rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, Ultra-HD televisions, etc.); and rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, Ultra-HD televisions, etc.); and •availability of content (for example, Ultra-HD programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming). availability of content (for example, Ultra-HD programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming). The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: •not offering the products and services that our customers want; not offering the products and services that our customers want; •having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; •not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; •delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and •damage to our brand and reputation. damage to our brand and reputation. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2016, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 75% of the merchandise we purchased (73% in fiscal 2015), with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG Electronics – representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased (47% in fiscal 2015). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or any other terms. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. To varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages -- for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brand with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers -- to our commercial disadvantage, with a consequent adverse impact on our profitability. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues, consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships. We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Carriers may decide to  Table of Contents Table of Contents cease allowing us to offer their contracts, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms. Each of these potential factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, port delays, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results.  Our focus on services as a strategic imperative exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation. Our customer promises include provision of a full range of services to complement our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans, repair, technical support and educational classes. These services can differentiate us from many of our competitors and provide an opportunity to deliver superior customer service while generating incremental revenue and profit. However, designing, marketing and executing these services successfully and consistently is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example: •increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue; increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue; •unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses; unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses; •employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes; these factors may increase our scope of liability related to our employees' actions; employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes; these factors may increase our scope of liability related to our employees' actions; •employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and •the engagement of third party contractors to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations. the engagement of third party contractors to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations. In addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. If, for these or other reasons, we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services, our reputation, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: •whether or not they make a purchase; whether or not they make a purchase; •their choice of brand, model or price-point; their choice of brand, model or price-point; •how frequently they upgrade their devices; and how frequently they upgrade their devices; and •their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). Consumer confidence, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors. Interruptions to our supply chain and other factors affecting our distribution may adversely affect our business. Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online. We also depend on third parties for certain aspects of our supply chain network. In managing our supply chain we are exposed to the following risks, for example, which may not be fully controllable by us: •interruptions to our delivery capabilities; interruptions to our delivery capabilities; Table of Contents Table of Contents •failure of third party companies to meet our standards or commitments; failure of third party companies to meet our standards or commitments; •disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems; disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems; •limitations in capacity; limitations in capacity; •consolidation or other changes in the distribution market; consolidation or other changes in the distribution market; •labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain; labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain; •damages or other loss to products; and damages or other loss to products; and •costs that are excessive. costs that are excessive. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries, because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The aforementioned channel shift increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our business and operating results may be harmed.  Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees, including our executive team and other employees in key positions. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.  Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues and other factors, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability. Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies.  We operate in a highly-competitive and ever-changing commercial environment. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment. Strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future. Our current strategy includes transformational change to certain areas of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities. It is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them.  Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding our strategies. Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omni-channel strategy. We primarily secure properties through operating leases with third-party landlords. In light of the long-term nature of most of these commitments, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: •changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment; changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment; Table of Contents Table of Contents •the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio; the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio; •the formats and sizes of our stores; the formats and sizes of our stores; •the locations of our stores; the locations of our stores; •the interior layouts of our stores; the interior layouts of our stores; •the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores; the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores; •the local competitive positioning in and around our stores; the local competitive positioning in and around our stores; •the primary term lease commitment for each store; the primary term lease commitment for each store; •the long-term lease option coverage for each store; the long-term lease option coverage for each store; •the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; •our supply chain network strategy; and our supply chain network strategy; and •our ongoing network of service locations. our ongoing network of service locations. If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors, fail to negotiate terms which keep us market competitive, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: •having to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the lease; having to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the lease; •incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores; incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores; •having stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and having stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and •bearing excessive lease expenses. bearing excessive lease expenses. These consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. We are still responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors, because, for example, of our differential service offerings or levels of customer service. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms.  We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.  Our credit ratings and outlooks at January 30, 2016 are summarized below. In fiscal 2016, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB to BB+ with a Stable outlook. Moody's Investors Service, Inc. upgraded its long-term credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1 with a Stable outlook. Fitch Ratings Limited upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB to BBB- with a Stable outlook. Table of Contents Table of Contents Rating Agency Rating OutlookStandard and Poor's BB+ StableMoody's Baa1 StableFitch BBB- Stable Rating Agency Rating OutlookStandard and Poor's BB+ StableMoody's Baa1 StableFitch BBB- Stable Rating Agency Rating OutlookStandard and Poor's BB+ StableMoody's Baa1 StableFitch BBB- Stable Standard and Poor's Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk, and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of promotional activity and customer buying patterns, and forecasting and reacting to these factors quickly is difficult. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems, or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results are adversely affected. Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. In the future, we may decide to enter into new ventures, alliances or acquisitions. Assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct. In addition, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited.  The success of ventures, alliances or acquisitions is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the venture or alliance partners, which can change following a transaction. Integrating new businesses, stores or concepts can be difficult and risky. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital. Entering into new ventures, alliances or acquisitions may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate businesses that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures, or we may encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to effectively integrate and manage strategic ventures, alliances and acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity and may require impairment of associated goodwill, tradenames or other assets.  Failure to protect the integrity, security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers. The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. In addition, any compromise of our data  Table of Contents Table of Contents security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.  Natural disasters, changes in climate, geo-political events or other catastrophes could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example: •natural disasters or extreme weather events; natural disasters or extreme weather events; •diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners; diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners; •floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or •terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts. terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.  Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Init, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our operating results: •we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions; we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions; •we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls; we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls; •we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters; we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters; •we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer; we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer; •we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner; we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner; •we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products; we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products; •we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and •regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation. regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation. Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.  We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are: •the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions; the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions; Table of Contents Table of Contents •the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials; the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials; •ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport; ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport; •the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise; the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise; •the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure; the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure; •the impact of changes in global tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and the impact of changes in global tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and •the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters. the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters. Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.  Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.  As an employer of approximately 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:  •unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the U.S. the National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of January 30, 2016, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements; unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the U.S. the National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of January 30, 2016, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements; •laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and •laws that impact minimum wage and scheduling requirements, that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. laws that impact minimum wage and scheduling requirements, that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and thus our revenue and profitability. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We view our financing programs as a way to generate incremental revenue of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment. Approximately 21% of our fiscal 2016 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate (whether from internal or external factors), or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. Table of Contents Table of Contents We utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications.
