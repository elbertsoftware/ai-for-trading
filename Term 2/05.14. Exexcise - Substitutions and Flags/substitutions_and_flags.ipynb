    "# Substitutions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, the `re` module also has functions that allow us to modify strings. Regex objects have the `.sub()` method that allows us to replace patterns within a string. Let' see an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we have a multi-line string that contains two instances of the ampersand character, `&`. Let's use the `.sub` method to replace these ampersands with the word `and`. First we will create a regular expression that matches all the `&` characters in our string. Then we will use `regex.sub(r'and', sample_text)` to replace every match of the `regex` expression in the `sample_text` with the raw string `and`. Let's see this in action:"

    "# Substitutions with Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do more sophisticated substitutions by using groups. Let's see an example. In the code below we have a multi-line string that contains the names of 4 people. As we can see, some people have middle names but other don't. Let's use the `.sub()` method to replace all names in the string with just the first and last name. For example, the name `John David Smith` should be replaced by `John Smith` and `Alice Jackson` should stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a regular expression that matches all the names in the list. Now, keeping in mind that we need to be able to make replacements later we will use groups to be able to distinguish between the first name, the middle name, and the last name. Since all names have a first name then we can use this group `([a-zA-z]+)` to match all the first names. Now, not all names have middle names, so having a middle name is optional. Since the first and middle name are separated by a whitespace we also need to indicate that the whitespace is also optional. So, to do indicate that the whitespace and middle name are optional we will include the `?` metacharacter after the whitespace and second group, `[ ]?([a-zA-z]+)?`. After the first or middle name we have a whitespace that we can match with `\\[  \\]`. Notice that in this case we didn't use the sequence `\\\\s` since this will match newlines as well and we don't what match those. Finally we make a third group to match the last name. Since all names have last names, we don't need to use the `?` metacharacter. Putting all together we get:"

So, what we want to do in our case, is to replace every match with only the first and last names, or equivalently replace every match with the first and third groups. We can refer to each group in the `string` by using the backslash. For example, `regex.sub(r'\\1', , sample_text)` will replace every match with the first group. Here we have reference the first group by using `\\1` inside the `string`. Let's put it all together to see how it works:"

    "We saw at the beginning of this lesson that regexes are case sensitive, therefore we often have to use regexes with both uppercase and lower case letters. However, the `re.compile(pattern, flags)` function, has a `flag` keyword that can be used to allow more flexibility. For example, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be used to perform **case-insensitive** matching. In the code below we have a string that contains the name Walter written in two different combinations of upper and lower case letters. In order to be able to find this two renditions of Walter, we will probably have to use a long character set to be able to account for all possible combinations of lower and upper case letters. However, in this case we can use the `re.IGNORECASE` to indicate that we don't care about the case of the letters, we just want to find the name Walter no matter how it is written.
