    "# Finding Words Using Regexes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to find letters and words in a string using regular expressions. Throughout these lessons, we will use the `re` module from Python's standard library to work with regular expressions. The `re` module not only contains functions that allow us to check if a given regular expression matches a particular string, but also contains functions that allow us to modify strings in various ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by using a regular expression to find all the locations of a single letter in a given string. To do this, we will use the `re.compile()` function from the `re` module. The `re.compile(pattern)` function converts a regular expression `pattern` into a regular expression object. This allows us to save our regular expressions into objects that can be used later to perform pattern matching using various methods, such as `.match()`, `.search()`, `.findall()`, and `.finditer()`. Let’s see how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will find all the locations of the letter `a` in a string named `sample_text`. In this case, our regular expression pattern will just be `'a'` and we will pass it to the `re.compile()` function as a raw string. We will save the regular expression object returned by the `re.compile()` function in a variable called `regex`. We will then use the `.finditer()` method to search our `sample_text` for the given regular expression contained in the `regex` object. The `.finditer()` method returns an iterator with all the non-overlapping matches of our regular expression pattern in the string. We should also mention that the `.finditer()` method scans the strings from left-to-right, and returns the matches in the order found. Since the `.finditer()` method returns an iterator, we can loop through it to print all the matches, as shown below:"
